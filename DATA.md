# D3 Mini Project

For the mini project, I chose to try to answer the question: what does internet user growth look like and what does the future hold? 

I used the data from the World Bank, specifically the world development indicators surrounding these three things: 

* mobile subscribers per 100 people
* broadband subscribers per 100 people
* internet users per 100 people

Making line graphs for each of these metrics and for every country allows the user to quickly toggle to a country and see areas of growth and compare. I used transitions for effects when toggling.
